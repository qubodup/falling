Hi together, this will be 'falling', a simple arcade game, where you have to collect all coins and avoid the blocks. You are in the role of a blue egg with a funny spot above the eyes.

The state of the game is WIP now. At the moment, I'm testing qubodups idea of merging clouds. The application is written in C using SDL and SDL_Image. I'm learning C at the moment, so the source code might look like a mess. You can build it with

gcc $(sdl-config --cflags --libs) -lSDL_image -o falling main.c clouds.c filehandler.c birds.c

if you are in the 'falling' directory. A buildsystem is not available at the moment.
It should compile on all platforms supporting SDL, SDL_Image and the C standard libs.
