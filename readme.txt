Hi together, this will be 'falling', a simple arcade game, the story goes something like this:

(fixed typo)

The state of the game is WIP now. The application is written in C using SDL and SDL_Image. I'm learning C at the moment, so the source code might look like a mess. You can build it under linux using 'compile.sh', if the folder 'falling' is in your home directory.

It should compile on all platforms supporting SDL, SDL_Image and the C standard libs.

You can grab the .svg files of most of the sprites from opengameart.org.
